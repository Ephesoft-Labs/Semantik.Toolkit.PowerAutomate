## Pipe delimited file Export:
Exports the pipe delimited file in the required format with all columns

## Pipe delimited file export with column filter
Exports the pipe delimited file but only for columns whose header exactly matches (case-sensitive) the expected column names. Other columns are disregarded and not placed in the file.
Currently, the expected column names are:

- Item #
- Description
- Shipped
- Unit Price
- Ext Price
**Note** that a column name with a period cannot be set as expected because it is an illegal character in flow expression language.
